# Research Project Progress Tracker

## Project Overview

This repository tracks research on 73 national innovation problems, distributed among six team members. Each member is responsible for 12–13 problems. Their progress and research outputs are compiled below.

## Member Assignments & Progress
Once the research for a problem is completed, update it with a ✅ emoji and paste the Perplexity chat link.

Make sure to take notes for each and every problem, and then select the top 3 based on innovation and creativity. Prepare explanations for all three, and brainstorm together to finalize the perfect problem statement to proceed with.
